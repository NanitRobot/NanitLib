= NanitLib

This library is designed to work with Nanit boards: (Nanit Smart Home, Nanit Drone, Nanit Udron and Nanit Discovery). This library allows you to control the built-in display, two-channel DC motor driver. Monitor the state of the built-in Lithium-Ion battery.
With this library, you can program all Nanit boards in the Arduino IDE.


The project is actively developing. Our whole team is working on the development of the board, adding new functionality so that you can learn programming with the help of Nanit boards.

We try to make the board as flexible as possible so that our students' projects are complete with minimal connection of external modules, but we give the freedom to choose what to connect to the board


To use this library

[,cpp]
----
#include <NanitLib.h>
----

That's all you need to start learning the C/C++ programming language with Nanit
